# College-Book-Seller-senior-project-
This is the code from my senior project. I worked on a team with two other students to create an offline website. We chose to create a college book seller website where students would be able to post their used text books and sell them to other students. 

I was involved with the frontend of this website, using HTML and CSS only. I created the navigation bar, profile page, about us page, listing page, and a wishlist page.
